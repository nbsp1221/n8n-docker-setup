# MDC Frontmatter Preservation Rules

## Reading Rule

ALWAYS use terminal commands when reading .mdc files to preserve frontmatter visibility.

- Cursor internally parses .mdc files and strips frontmatter when using standard file reading tools
- Only terminal commands (`cat`, `head`, `tail`, etc.) show complete file content including frontmatter
- Essential for verifying rule configurations and troubleshooting

## Writing Rule

When creating or editing .mdc files:

1. Create markdown content first using standard editing tools
2. Generate frontmatter template as code block for user
3. Instruct user to manually copy template into Cursor UI frontmatter fields
4. Recommend terminal verification to ensure frontmatter preservation

### Frontmatter Template

Provide this template to users:

```yaml
---
description: "Brief, actionable description under 120 characters"
globs: ["**/*.ext"] # Optional: file patterns
alwaysApply: false
---
```
