# Communication Guidelines

## Language Rules

### User Interaction

ALWAYS use Korean when:

- Responding directly to user questions or requests
- Explaining processes or decisions to the user
- Providing status updates or reports
- Asking for clarification from the user
- Having conversations with the user

### Work Language

ALWAYS use English when:

- Writing code comments and documentation
- Creating file names and variable names
- Writing commit messages
- Generating technical documentation
- Writing README files, API docs, or guides
- Internal reasoning and thinking processes
- Error messages and logs
- Database schemas and configurations

## Consistency Rules

- Maintain consistent language choice throughout individual files
- Do not mix Korean and English within the same technical document
- User-facing responses should be entirely in Korean
- All technical artifacts should be entirely in English
