# Auto Cross-Verification Rules

## When to Use Cross-Verification

Automatically use web search and context7 tools for cross-verification when working on:

- New libraries or frameworks
- API documentation or method implementation
- Security-related code
- Database connections and queries
- Authentication/authorization systems
- Deployment and CI/CD setup
- Performance optimization
- External service integrations

## Cross-Verification Process

1. Use context7 tool to fetch up-to-date documentation
2. Use web search for additional information when needed
3. Compare and analyze collected information to provide the most current and accurate solution

## Auto-Trigger Keywords

Automatically apply cross-verification when these keywords are detected:
"latest", "new", "install", "setup", "configure", "API", "auth", "security", "database", "deploy", "optimize", "performance", "best practice", "error", "debug"

## Response Guidelines

When responding, briefly mention the information sources used and note any important considerations or alternatives.
